Briefcase Triple-Output Power Supply 

This is a recreational fun project that I did years ago. At this point, I was very new to electronics. 
This contraption uses mains electricity and outputs 0-30VDC (adjustable) and 6A total across three common-grounded independently adjustable channels. 
I used a junk briefcase to house all of the components. This would come handy if a lab supply was needed on the go. 
Everything was soldered using the point-to-point wiring technique. The current limiting and voltage adjustment knobs worked well.
